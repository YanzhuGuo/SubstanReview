# SubstanReview

The SubstanReview dataset consists of 550 annotated peer reviews (440 in the train set and 110 in the test set). It is released in the json line format with two different fields:

"review" includes the textual content of the peer review.

"label" includes the annotated spans of claim-evidence pairs. A claim span and an evidence span forms a pair if they are assigned with the same number. For example, "Jus_neg_1" is linked to "Eval_neg_1".
